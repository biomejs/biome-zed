        Please be aware that **issues without a minimal reproduction are likely to be closed** without
        further investigation. We NEED to be able to reproduce the issue in order to understand it
        and fix it.

        Please use the `npm create @biomejs/biome-reproduction` command whenever you can to bootstrap a reproduction
        repository.
